Chaldal.com react navigation filter
============

Demo - [http://aajahid.github.io/chaldal-react-search/](http://aajahid.github.io/chaldal-react-search/)

Based on requirements - this app shows a search text box and lists of category tree underneath generated from given JSON data sample.



The app is written in `es2015`.  I used `webpack` module bundler with react js npm packages ( react and react-dom ).  The webpack loads `Babel` compiler for supporting react and ES2015. The project have webpack configuration file with it to take care all these configuration.
 
Running the project
------

Original source are in `src` directory. For viewing purpose - you can open the `src/index.html` file in your browser and it will work.

For development purpose - it comes with NPM `package.json` file. Just go to project directory and use - 

    npm install
This will install all required packages for the project development.


To auto compile the bundle - run

    npm run dev
this basically runs the `webpack --watch` command.
